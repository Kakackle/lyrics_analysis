main concern promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me i said when the lights shut off and its my turn to settle down my main concern promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me i woke up this morning and figured id call you in case im not here tomorrow im hopin that i can borrow a peace of mind im behind on whats really important my mind is really distorted i find nothing but trouble in my life im fortunate you believe in a dream this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine and last night was just another distraction or a reaction of what we consider madness i know exactly what happened you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help held him like a newborn baby and made him feel like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up but the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will thats blood spilled on your hands my plans rather vindictive everybodys a victim in my eyes when i ride its a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black a demon glued to my back whispering ""get em"" i got em and i aint give a fuck that same mentality i told my brother not to duck in actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors i wonder if ill ever discover a passion like you and recover the life that i knew as a youngin in pajamas and duntaduns when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb niggas like me never prosper prognosis of a problem child im proud and welldevoted this piru shit been in me forever so forever ima push it wherever whenever and i love you cause you love my brother like you did just promise me youll tell this story when you make it big and if i die before your album drop i hope—  you might also like promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me i said when the lights shut off and its my turn to settle down my main concern promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me you wrote a song about my sister on your tape and called it section80 the message resembled ""brendas got a baby"" whats crazy was i was hearin about it but doubted your ignorance how could you ever just put her on blast and shit judgin her past and shit well its completely my future her nigga behind me right now askin for ass and shit and ima need that forty dollars even if i got to fuck suck and swallow in the parking lot gonzales park im followed by a married man and father of three my titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin keys matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with es he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week this is the life of another girl damaged by the system these foster homes i run away and never do miss em see my hormones just run away and if i can get em back to where they used to be then ill probably be in the denim of a family gene that show women how to be woman or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin then you probably need to beat her thats how i was taught three niggas in one room first time i was tossed and im exhausted but fuck that ""sorry for your loss"" shit my sister died in vain but what point are you tryna gain if you cant fit the pumps i walk in ill wait… your rebuttal a little too late and if you have a album date just make sure im not in the song cause i dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great a doctors approval is a waste of time i know im straight ill probably live longer than you and never fade away ill never fade away ill never fade away i know my fate and im on the grind for this cake ima get it or die tryin im eyein every male gender with intentions of buyin you lyin to these motherfuckers talkin about you can help em with my story you can help me if you sell this pussy for me nigga dont ignore me nigga fuck your glory nigga you aint shit… when the lights shut off and its my turn to settle down my main concern promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me i said when the lights shut off and its my turn to settle down my main concern promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me  sometimes i look in the mirror and ask myself am i really scared of passin away if its today i hope i hear a cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon with the holy ghost til it drown in the blood of jesus i wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin the scent of a reaper ensurin that my allegiance with the other side may come soon and if im doomed may the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons i suffer a lot and every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch i tie my stomach in knots and im not sure why im infatuated with death my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch maybe cause im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death really stuck in the schema of wonderin when ima rest and youre right your brother was a brother to me and your sisters situation was the one that pulled me in a direction to speak on somethin thats realer than the tv screen by any means wasnt tryin to offend or come between her personal life i was like ""it need to be told"" cursin the life of twenty generations after her soul exactly whatd happen if i aint continue rappin or steady bein distracted by money drugs and 45s i count lives all on these songs look at the weak and cry pray one day youll be strong fightin for your rights even when youre wrong and hope that at least one of you sing about me when im gone am i worth it did i put enough work in promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me i said when the lights shut
