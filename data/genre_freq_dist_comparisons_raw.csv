guys were corny but the girls were mad fly lounging with the tipster cooling with sha scoping out the honeys—they know who they are i was the bball playing fly rhyme saying fly girl getting but never was i sweating cause when it came to honeys i would go on a stroll until i met my match—her name was flo yeah i messed around with the one called flo all the troopers round the way used to call her a ho but deep down in my heart i knew that flo was good to go cause i thought it was me like bell biv devoe but little did i know that she was playing with my mind the only thing i learned is good girls are hard to find i feel like heavy d i need somebody for me not someone whose mind is blank and tryna juice me for my banks swinging with my main man lucky behind my back what type of crap is that—yo hows about a smack word life i cant front thought i was all that but now it seems ive met my match i was a stone cold lover you couldnt tell me jack settling down with one girl wasnt trying to hear that i had tonya tamika sharon karen tina stacy julie tracy used to love em leave em skeeze em tease em find em lose em  also abuse em my whole attitude was new day next hon and believe it or not they all got done well here comes flo with the crazy whip appeal and im all true man like alexander oneal is this really love then again how would i know after all this time trying to be a super ho she finally played me but yo id find another cause i got the crazy game and yo im smooth like butter you might also like ayo its like butter its like butter baby its like butter its like butter baby its

from looking fly you get an e for effort and t for nice try now tell me whats the reason for dying your hair slum village gold still dangling in your ear you barely have a neck but still sporting a rope fourfinger ring just so phifer can scope you looked in the mirror didnt know what to do yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true and if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you if your hair and eyes were real i wouldnt have dissed ya but since it was bought i had to dismiss ya but if you cant achieve it then why not try and weave it if you cant extend it then you might as well suspend it if you cant braid it best thing to do is fade it i asked who did your hair and you tell me ""diane made it"" if you were you and just you talk to you maybe but i cant stand no bionic lady trying hard to look fly but yo youre looking dumber if i wanted someone like you i wouldve swung with jaime sommers you wanna be

worshipped but if i could go back id at least reword it and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that hes deserted but i think its workin these verses are makin him a wee bit nervous and hes too scurred to answer me with words cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least hes heard it cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin him or ask if im linked to terrorists i said ""only when it comes to ink and lyricists"" but my beef is more media journalists hold up hold up hold up i

allegiance with the other side may come soon and if im doomed may the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons i suffer a lot and every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch i tie my stomach in knots and im not sure why im infatuated with death my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful and i can name a list of your favorites

money or cause somebody think they sexy but they valuable cause they been created by god and god makes you valuable and whether or not you recognize that value is one thing you got a lot of societies

woods i was so ragged the folks used to call me ""patches"" papa used to tease me about it course deep down inside he was hurt cause hed done all he could my papa was a great old man i can see him with a shovel in his hand see education he never had he did wonders when the time got bad the little money from the crops he raised barely paid the bills we made oh life had kicked him down to the ground when he tried to get up life would kick him back down one day papa called me to his dyin bed put his hands on my shoulders and in tears he said he said ""patches im depending on you son to pull the family through my son its all left up to you"" two days later papa passed away and i became a man that day so i told mama i was gonna quit school but she said that was daddys strictest rule you might also likeso every morning fore i went to school i fed the chickens and i chopped wood too sometimes i felt that i couldnt go on i wanted to leave just run away from home but i would remember what my daddy said with tears in his eyes on his dyin bed he said ""patches im depending on you son ive tried to do my best its up to you to do the rest"" then one day a strong rain came and washed all the crops away and at the age of thirteen i thought i was carrying the weight of the whole world on my shoulders and you know mama knew what i was going through cause every day i had to work the fields cause thats the only way we got our meals see i was the oldest of the family and everybody else depended on me every night i heard my mama pray ""lord give him strength to make another day"" though years have passed and all the kids have grown the angels took mama to a brand new home lord knows people i shedded tears but my daddys voice helped me through the years sayin ""patches im depending on you son to pull the family through my son its all left up to you"" oh i could still hear papas voice sayin ""patches im depending on you son ive tried to do my best its up to you to do the rest"" i could still hear papa when hes saying ""patches im depending on you son to pull the family through my son its all left up to you"" when i start makin love i dont just make love i be
