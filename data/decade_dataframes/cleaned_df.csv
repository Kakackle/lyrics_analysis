i ever ever saw one there wasnt a nigga on the block late at night not getting done so she begged me not to tell a soul then i said of course cause my dick yo its harder than a totem pole then again

is really distorted i find nothing but trouble in my life im fortunate you believe in a dream this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine and last night was just another distraction or a reaction of what we consider madness i know exactly what happened you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help held him like a newborn baby and made him feel like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up but the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will thats blood spilled on your hands my plans rather vindictive everybodys a victim in my eyes when i ride its a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black a demon glued to my back whispering ""get em"" i got em and i aint give a fuck that same mentality i told my brother not to duck in actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors i wonder if ill ever discover a passion like you and recover the life that i knew as a youngin in pajamas and duntaduns when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb niggas like me never prosper prognosis of a problem child im proud and welldevoted this piru shit been in me forever so forever ima push it wherever whenever and i love you cause you love my brother like you

your rebuttal a little too late and if you have a album date just make sure im not in the song cause i dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great a doctors approval is a waste of time i know im straight ill probably live longer than you and never fade away ill never fade away ill never fade away i know my fate and im on

promise that you will sing about me i said when the lights shut off and its my turn to settle down my main concern promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me  sometimes i look in the mirror and ask myself am i really scared of passin away if its today i hope i hear a cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon with the holy ghost til it drown in the blood of jesus i wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin the scent of a reaper ensurin that my allegiance with the other side may come soon and if im doomed may the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons i suffer a lot and every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch i tie my stomach in knots and im not sure why im infatuated with death my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch maybe cause im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death really stuck in the schema of wonderin when ima rest and youre right your brother was a brother to me and your sisters situation was the one that pulled me in a direction to speak on somethin thats realer than the tv screen by any means wasnt tryin to offend or come between her personal life i was like ""it need to be told"" cursin the life of twenty generations after her soul exactly whatd happen if i aint continue rappin or steady bein distracted by money drugs and 45s i count lives all on these songs look at the weak and cry pray one day youll be strong fightin for your rights even when youre wrong

how i maneuver this game i aint stupid i recognize that life is a dream and i dream lucid and break the chains and change minds one verse at a time and claim 26 and fuck it if the shoe fits whos the king we all kings we all kings nigga kings of ourselves first and foremost true while the people debate whos the king of this rap game hehehaha here comes lil ol jermaine with every ounce of strength in his veins to snatch the crown from whoever yall think has it true but rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it poof boom paow its like magic with a flash and a bang the crown disintegrates and falls to the earth from which it came its done aint gon be no more kings aint gon be no more kings be wary of any man that claims because deep down he clings onto the need for power mm in reality hes a coward mm ultimately hes scared to die and sometimes so am i but when im in tune with the most high i realize the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side the other side ayy today i know that we are the same are the same you and i yessir different kind of skin different set of eyes two different minds but only one god its only one god nigga its for all the kings uh cause i know deep down every poet just wanna be loved,https://images.genius.com/84a98a8d26b13b7311aa2359ebade757.1000x1000x1.jpg,2020s

myself as nothin but a criminal control the block servin up rocks and stay subliminal cause young niggas is hardheaded they lettin off full of adrenaline ignorant to what death can cause aint no comin back family dressed in black plus its hot now the cops outside its hard to flip a pack and my daughter gotta eat her mama be stressin me like i aint the one who put them js on her feet like i aint out in the field like that i might be low for the moment but i will bounce back despite the charges back to the wall i fight regardless screamin ""fuck the law"" my life is lawless thats what you call it aint got to be no psychic to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven this is hell and i dont mean that hyperbolic i try to find employment even if its wipin toilets but these felonies be makin life the hardest resistin the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet or run up on your yard snatch your daughter bike and pawn it thats why i write this sonnet if the pressure get too much for me to take and i break play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it for your eyes let her know my life is on it for your eyes for your eyes only you might also like for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes only  you prolly grown now so this songll hit you if you hearin this unfortunately means that im no longer with you in the physical not even sure if i believe in god but because you still alive he got me prayin that the spiritual is real so i can be a part of you still my pops was killed too so i know how part of you feels maybe you hate me maybe you miss me maybe you spite me life goes in cycles maybe youll date a nigga just like me i hope not im tired of dope spots and fiends that smoke rocks ive seen far too many niggas hopes rot im writin this because me and the devil had a dance now i see death around the corner pologizin in advance dont know if i ever had a chance at a glance im a failure addicted to pushin paraphernalia but daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once innocence disappeared by the age of eight years my pops shot up drugrelated mama addicted so granny raised me in projects where thugs was hangin blood was stainin the concrete older niggas i loved talked like they was above maintainin a timesheet thats slow money picked up the family business by the age of thirteen six years later was handed sentence round the same time is when you came in this world me and your mama thinkin ""what the fuck we namin this girl"" i told her ""nina"" the prettiest name that i could think of most prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen for the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen i was nineteen took me two felonies to see the trap this crookedass system set for me and now i fear its too late for me to ever be the one that set examples that was never set for me im livin fast but not fast enough cause karma keeps on catchin up to me and if my past becomes the death of me i hope you understand for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand hope you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand hope you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes only  its several ways i couldve went out too many to count was it the triggerhappy crackers that the badges give clout was it the young niggas blastin frustrated cause the cash runnin out niggas dont know how to act in a drought see baby girl i realized my definition of a real nigga was skewed my views misshaped by new mixtapes that confirmed the shit i learned in the streets was true that real niggas dont speak when they beef with you they just pull up on your street let the heat achoo and if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food i was a fool spent all my time duckin school duckin cops duckin rules huggin blocks that dont love you i pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you into a box where your son dont even know his pops and the cyclical nature of doin time continues my worst fear is one day that you come home from school and see your father face while hearin bout tragedy on news i got the strangest feelin your daddy gonna lose his life soon and sadly if youre listenin now it must mean its true but maybe theres a chance that its not and this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels and i can teach you this in person like im teachin you to tie your own shoes i love you and i hope to god i dont lose you for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes do you understand for your eyes only  one day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feelin what hed been dealin with lately he wasnt tellin i tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealin but i could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chillin he said ""jermaine i knew you since we was children i never asked for nothin when times was hard i never had discussions with you beggin you to help me i dealt with the repercussions of my actions i know you tried to steer me way from that shit but that shit was in my blood you know my life i know your momma nigga send my love in case i never get a chance to speak again i wont forget the weekends spent sleepin at your crib thats the way i wished my family lived but my granny crib was in the jects"" i had to interject like ""nigga what you talkin bout fuck is you gettin at"" he said ""listen i got no time to dive into descriptions but i been havin premonitions just call it visions from the other side i got a feelin i wont see tomorrow like the time im livin on is borrowed with that said the only thing im proud to say i was a father write my story down and if i pass go play it for my daughter when she ready"" and so im leavin you this record for your eyes only dont you ever scratch or disrespect it this perspective is a real one another lost ville son i dedicate these words to you and all the other children affected by the mass incarceration in this nation that sent your pops to prison when he needed education sometimes i think that segregation wouldve done us better although i know that means that i would never be brought into this world cause my daddy was so thrilled when he found him a white girl to take back to jonesboro with lil zach and cole world barely one years old now its thirty years later makin sure this storys told girl your daddy was a real nigga not cause he was cold not because he was the first to get some pussy twelve years old not because he used to come through in the caddy on some vogues not because he went from baggin up them grams to servin os nah your daddy was a real nigga not cause he was hard not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars not because he screamed ""fuck the law"" although that was true your daddy was a real nigga cause he loved you for your eyes
